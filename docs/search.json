    "text": "The framework\nWe can model whether inbreeding can invade an outbreeding population by counting the number of alleles that would be propagated by inbreeding individuals, compared to the number of alleles propagated if the individual were to instead outbreed. Let the average number of alleles propagated by an outbreeding female across her lifetime be \\(N_\\mathrm{f}\\), with the fraction \\(1/N_\\mathrm{f}\\) transmitted per effective mating. For an inbreeding female, the allele counting is more complex. Following Waser et al. (1986), let the number of alleles transmitted to offspring produced as a result of a single inbreeding event be \\((1 - \\delta)\\), where \\(\\delta\\) represents inbreeding depression. Investment in this mating and subsequent reproduction (e.g. through parental care) may affect future reproductive output; let this cost be \\(\\Delta N_\\mathrm{f}\\), such that future allele propagation is \\(N_\\mathrm{f} - \\Delta N_\\mathrm{f}\\). Finally, the number of allele copies indirectly propagated by the related male mating partner is \\(r(1 - \\delta - \\Delta N_\\mathrm{m})\\), where \\(r\\) is the genealogical relatedness coefficient and \\(\\Delta N_\\mathrm{m}\\) is the cost of male reproductive investment to his future allele propagation. Taken together, inbreeding is favoured for females when\n\\[(1 - \\delta) + (N_\\mathrm{f} - \\Delta N_\\mathrm{f}) + r(1 - \\delta - \\Delta N_\\mathrm{m}) &gt; N_\\mathrm{f}, \\qquad \\tag{1}\\]\nand for males when\n\\[(1 - \\delta) + (N_\\mathrm{m} - \\Delta N_\\mathrm{m}) + r(1 - \\delta - \\Delta N_\\mathrm{f}) &gt; N_\\mathrm{m}. \\qquad \\tag{2}\\]\nEquation 1 and Equation 2 can be rearranged to show that inbreeding is favoured by selection on females when:\n\\[\\delta_\\mathrm{f} &lt; \\frac{(1 -\\Delta N_\\mathrm{f}) + (r - r\\Delta N_\\mathrm{m})}{1 + r} \\tag{3}\\]\nand on males\n\\[\\delta_\\mathrm{m} &lt; \\frac{(1 -\\Delta N_\\mathrm{m}) + (r - r\\Delta N_\\mathrm{f})}{1 + r} \\tag{4}\\]\nIf a round of reproduction following an inbred mating completely replaces the opportunity for an outbred round of reproduction in females (\\(\\Delta N_\\mathrm{f} = 1\\)), but has no effect on the future reproductive prospects of males (\\(\\Delta N_\\mathrm{f} = 0\\)) we recover \\(\\delta_\\mathrm{f} &lt; \\frac{r}{1 + r}\\) and \\(\\delta_\\mathrm{m} &lt; \\frac{1}{1 + r}\\), as previously found by Parker (1979)."

Let \\(c = (\\Delta N_\\mathrm{f} + \\Delta N_\\mathrm{m})/2\\), the amount of care received by offspring, averaged across parents.

Hence, the corresponding purple line never appears on the figure.\n\n\nNow, what happens when males care? Inspecting Equation 7 and Equation 8 reveals two, opposing effects. Increasing \\(\\Delta N_\\mathrm{m}\\) decreases the size of the numerator, or put biologically, reduces a males future reproductive success. However it also leads to an increase in \\(c\\), mitigating the effect of inbreeding depression on offspring production/survival and decreasing the size of the denominator. Whether inbreeding is favoured when males invest more in care depends on the \\(\\alpha\\) parameter.\nPlot this tomorrow"
