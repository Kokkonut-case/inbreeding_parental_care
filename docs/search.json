    "text": "The framework\nWe can model whether inbreeding can invade an outbreeding population by counting the number of alleles that would be propagated by inbreeding individuals, compared to the number of alleles propagated if the individual were to instead outbreed. Let the average number of alleles propagated by an outbreeding female across her lifetime be \\(N_\\mathrm{f}\\), with the fraction \\(1/N_\\mathrm{f}\\) transmitted per effective mating. For an inbreeding female, the allele counting is more complex. Let the number of alleles transmitted to offspring produced as a result of a single inbreeding event be \\((1 - \\delta)\\), where \\(\\delta\\) represents inbreeding depression. Investment in this mating and subsequent reproduction (e.g. through parental care) may affect future reproductive output; following Waser et al. (1986), let this cost be \\(\\Delta N_\\mathrm{f}\\), such that future allele propagation is \\(N_\\mathrm{f} - \\Delta N_\\mathrm{f}\\). Finally, the number of allele copies indirectly propagated by the related male mating partner is \\(r(1 - \\delta - \\Delta N_\\mathrm{m})\\), where \\(r\\) is the genealogical relatedness coefficient and \\(\\Delta N_\\mathrm{m}\\) is the cost of male reproductive investment to his future allele propagation. \\(\\Delta N_\\mathrm{f}\\) and \\(\\Delta N_\\mathrm{m}\\) will generally range between zero and one, where zero indicates no cost to future mating success, while one represents complete replacement of an outcrossing event. Taken together, inbreeding is favoured for females when\n\\[(1 - \\delta) + (N_\\mathrm{f} - \\Delta N_\\mathrm{f}) + r(1 - \\delta - \\Delta N_\\mathrm{m}) &gt; N_\\mathrm{f} \\qquad \\tag{1}\\]\nand for males when\n\\[(1 - \\delta) + (N_\\mathrm{m} - \\Delta N_\\mathrm{m}) + r(1 - \\delta - \\Delta N_\\mathrm{f}) &gt; N_\\mathrm{m} \\qquad \\tag{2}\\]\nEquation 1 and Equation 2 can be rearranged to show that inbreeding is favoured by selection on females when:\n\\[\\delta_\\mathrm{f} &lt; \\frac{(1 -\\Delta N_\\mathrm{f}) + (r - r\\Delta N_\\mathrm{m})}{1 + r} \\tag{3}\\]\nand on males\n\\[\\delta_\\mathrm{m} &lt; \\frac{(1 -\\Delta N_\\mathrm{m}) + (r - r\\Delta N_\\mathrm{f})}{1 + r}\\]\nIf a round of reproduction following an inbred mating completely replaces the opportunity for an outbred round of reproduction in females (\\(\\Delta N_\\mathrm{f} = 1\\)), but has no effect on the future reproductive prospects of males (\\(\\Delta N_\\mathrm{f} = 0\\)) we recover \\(\\delta_\\mathrm{f} &lt; \\frac{r}{1 + r}\\) and \\(\\delta_\\mathrm{m} &lt; \\frac{1}{1 + r}\\), as previously found by Parker (1979)."

As shown previously, relatedness between mating partners has opposite effects depending on the sex expressing the inbreeding allele. To show why, Equation 4 and Equation 5 can be rearranged in the form of Hamilton’s rule \\(rb &gt; c\\). Let \\(\\alpha = 0\\) (no effect of care - shown by the yellow line in the Figure), and as before, \\(\\Delta N_\\mathrm{f} = 1\\) and \\(\\Delta N_\\mathrm{m} = 0\\). For alleles expressed in females we find that selection favours inbreeding when\n\\[\\underbrace{r(1 - \\delta)}_\\textrm{male benefit} &gt; \\underbrace{\\delta}_\\textrm{female cost}\\] where inbreeding is a form of altruism. For alleles expressed in males, the altruistic behaviour is to avoid inbreeding (thus sparing females a bout of inbred offspring). To aid interpretation, I flip the inequality to instead express the conditions for selection to favour males to behave selfishly and hence to increase the frequency of alleles that code for inbreeding\n\\[\\underbrace{1 - \\delta}_\\textrm{male benefit} &gt; \\underbrace{r\\delta}_\\textrm{female cost}\\]\nThus, relatedness expands the space where selection favours inbreeding for females, but reduces it for males.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWhen \\(\\alpha = 1\\), selection will favour males that inbreed in all cases where inbreeding depression &lt; 1. Hence, the corresponding dark purple line never appears on the figure.\n\n\nNow, what happens when males care? Insepction of Equation 6 and Equation 7 reveals two, opposing effects. Increasing \\(\\Delta N_\\mathrm{m}\\) decreases the size of the numerator, or put biologically, reduces a male’s future reproductive success. However it also leads to an increase in \\(c\\), mitigating the effect of inbreeding depression on offspring production/survival, thus decreasing the size of the denominator. Whether inbreeding is favoured when males invest more in care depends largely on the \\(\\alpha\\) parameter.\n\n\nCode\n# females\n\nparameters_f_care &lt;- expand_grid(r = seq(from = 0, to = 1, by = 0.05),\n                          delta = seq(from = 0, to = 1, by = 0.05),\n                          a = c(0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 0.999),\n                          N_m = seq(from = 0, to = 1, by = 0.1)) %&gt;% \n  mutate(depression_threshold = (r - r*N_m) / (1 + r - ((1+N_m)/2)*a - ((1+N_m)/2)*r*a),\n         control_threshold = r / (1 + r),\n         sex = \"delta[f]\")\n\n# males\n\nparameters_m_care &lt;- expand_grid(r = seq(from = 0, to = 1, by = 0.05),\n                          delta = seq(from = 0, to = 1, by = 0.05),\n                          a = c(0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 0.999),\n                          N_m = seq(from = 0, to = 1, by = 0.1)) %&gt;% \n  mutate(depression_threshold = (1 - N_m) / (1 + r - ((1+N_m)/2)*a - ((1+N_m)/2)*r*a),\n         control_threshold = 1 / (1 + r),\n         sex = \"delta[m]\")\n\n# combine\n\ncare_parameters &lt;-\n  bind_rows(parameters_f_care, parameters_m_care) %&gt;% \n  mutate(a = case_when(a == 0 ~ \"alpha*' = 0'\",\n                       a == 0.25 ~ \"alpha*' = 0.25'\",\n                       a == 0.5 ~ \"alpha*' = 0.5'\",\n                       a == 0.75 ~ \"alpha*' = 0.75'\",\n                       a == 0.999 ~ \"alpha*' = 0.999'\"))\n  \n# plot\n\ndelta_Nm_pc_plot &lt;-\n  care_parameters %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(x = r, y = depression_threshold, group = N_m, colour = N_m)) +\n  geom_line(linewidth = 1.4) + \n  geom_line(aes(y = control_threshold), linetype = 2, colour = \"black\") +\n  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 1)) +\n  scale_colour_carto_c(palette = \"SunsetDark\", type = \"qualitative\",\n                       limits = c(0, 1)) +\n  labs(x = '_r_, the relatedness coefficient',\n       y = ~delta~'(inbreeding depression)',\n       colour = \"Male care\") +\n  facet_grid(sex ~ factor(a, levels = c(\"alpha*' = 0'\", \"alpha*' = 0.25'\",\n                                        \"alpha*' = 0.5'\", \"alpha*' = 0.75'\",\n                                        \"alpha*' = 0.999'\")), labeller = label_parsed) +\n  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0, 0.009), breaks = c(0, 0.5, 1)) + \n  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0.009)) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(text = element_text(size = 16),\n        strip.text = element_text(size = 18),\n        strip.text.y = element_text(angle = 0),\n        strip.background = element_rect(fill = \"aliceblue\"),\n        axis.title = element_text(size = 20),\n        axis.title.x = element_markdown(),\n        panel.spacing.x = unit(1.2, \"lines\"),\n        panel.spacing.y = unit(1, \"lines\"))\n\ndelta_Nm_pc_plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.

See the fraction of lines that fall below the dashed, black control line in Figure 3.\nMale care reduces the invasion prospects of inbreeding alleles, irrespective of the sex they are expressed in.\nHowever, when care has a large mitigating effect on inbreeding depression (large \\(\\alpha\\)), the conditions for inbreeding alleles to invade become more permissive, even when males invest quite a lot in care. For example, when care reduces inbreeding depression by 75%, and males lose half a future outbred mating, the invasion prospects of an inbreeding strategy are equivalent to the control condition (where substantial inbreeding depression can be tolerated)."

    "text": "How we can test this?\nThis depends on the pliability and specifics of the Burying beetle system. First, males must care to a lesser extent than females and a inbred mating must not completely replace an outbred one i.e. inbreeding must increase lifetime mating success of males. If the degree of care provided by a male can be manipulated without much change in female care and this feeds back into future male mating prospects, then experimental evolution could be very cool.\nManipulating the effectiveness of care would also be interesting. An experiment with standardised levels of care provided by both parents, but with treatments that vary in care effectiveness, the model predicts a decrease in inbreeding preference."
